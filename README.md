This is the repository which has few projects which was done in my academics(both B.E and Masters) and helped me to learn and improve knowledge in various domains.

I have worked on Database project, web designing , computer graphics , Artificial Intelligence based projects like face emotion recognition and speech emotion recognition, and Data preprocessing projects which involved cleaning of data, visulization of data using python libraries, analysis of data using EDA technique, and building a machine learning model to predict the accuracy of the model for the taken data,etc.

I am still doing many projects on different data's and will be uploading soon.
